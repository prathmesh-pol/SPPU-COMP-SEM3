# 2 Set 
# Operations
# In second year computer engineering class, group A studentâ€™s play cricket, group B 
# students play badminton and group C students play football. Write a Python 
# program using functions to compute following: - 
# a) List of students who play both cricket and badminton 
# b) List of students who play either cricket or badminton but not both 
# c) Number of students who play neither cricket nor badminton 
# d) Number of students who play cricket and football but not badminton. 
# e) Number of students who do not play any game 
# f) List of students who play at least one game 
# g) List of students who play all three games. 
# (Note- While realizing the group, duplicate entries should be avoided, Do not use SET built-in functions)
